## Installing Go for your environment

You might use your package manager to install Go or install manually from the
official release binaries. Either way should be easy.

Because the `go` tool is able to download code from remote repositories, it is
often useful to have installed clients for the various supported version control
systems. At the time of this writing, they are
[documented](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths) as: Bazaar,
Git, Mercurial and Subversion.

They are not mandatory requirements, you might go a long way with just having
`git` installed, and installing others later as required. In any case, to
install all of them:

```
dnf install bzr git mercurial subversion      # Fedora
yum install bzr git mercurial subversion      # RHEL / CentOS
brew install bazaar git mercurial subversion  # macOS with Homebrew
```

### Installation using a package manager

```
dnf install golang  # Fedora
yum install golang  # RHEL / CentOS
brew install go     # macOS with Homebrew
```

### Installation from official binary releases

1. Download an archive for the desired version and platform from
https://golang.org/dl/.
2. Follow the [installation
instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install). The main steps are outlined
below.

For macOS, execute the package installer from the downloads page.

For Linux, download a `.tar.gz` archive and extract it into `/usr/local`,
creating a Go tree in `/usr/local/go`. For example:

```
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Finally, add `/usr/local/go/bin` to the PATH environment variable. You can do
this by adding this line to your `/etc/profile` (for a system-wide installation)
or `$HOME/.profile` (or `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, ...):

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```


## Understanding the GOPATH environment variable

The GOPATH environment variable lists places to look for Go code. It defines
your workspace. It is likely the only environment variable you'll need to set
when developing Go code.

Official documentation:

- [How to Write Go Code: The GOPATH environment variable](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)
- [Command go: GOPATH environment variable](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable)

Normally the GOPATH is set in your shell profile (one of `~/.bashrc`,
`~/.bash_profile`, etc).

When you install packages and build binaries, the Go tool will look for source
code in `$GOPATH/src/` followed by a package import path in order to resolve
dependencies. More on this shortly.

The GOPATH works like the PATH environment variable, where you can have multiple
locations separated by a `:` (`;` on Windows).

Some people prefer to use a single path workspace, like
`GOPATH=/Users/kelly/work/go`. Others use multiple paths, like
`GOPATH=/home/rodolfo/.go-vendor:/home/rodolfo/Dropbox/go:/home/rodolfo/openshift`.
When using multiple paths, the Go tool will download and install new packages to
the first path in the list, while preserving the same path when building
existing source code.

Make sure to have a line defining your GOPATH in your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent:

```
export $GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

---
**Pro tip**: include also a line to add GOPATH/bin to your PATH, so that you can
easily run built and installed binaries:

```
# Include every ./bin directory from GOPATHs into PATH
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin"
```
---


## Setting up and verifying your worksapce

Once we have the $GOPATH env var setup, we need to create a directory structure for our projects that Go understands.
Go's best practice is to have packages / projects as resolvable paths. An example would be: ``` github.com/golang/lint/golint ```
This is a package on github if you browe to ``` https://github.com/golang/lint ``` you can see the code there. The go get command expects a resovable path backed by one of the common CVS systems (git,mercurial etc)
When you run the go get command, it will checkout the repo at $GOPATH/src/github.com/golang/lint/golint and you refer to it in your files as an import. The import path tells the Go compiler where to find the source for your projects.
```
  import "github.com/golang/lint/golint"
```

So to be good Gophers we will also follow this best practice. Before we finish lets complete our workspace by creating the following dirs

```
  mkdir -p $GOPATH/src // where go get will store the source of packages. Our code will also live here under our own namespace.
  mkdir -p $GOPATH/bin // where executables are install when you run go install
  mkdir -p $GOPATH/pkg // where package objects are stored things like .a files

```  

## Installing some common tools
 - golint  ``` go get github.com/golang/lint/golint ```  
 - goimports ``` go get  golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports ```

golint looks for common code style. Things such as documenting Exported functions.
goimports formats your code correctly and also removes any unused imports. It will also try to resolve imports that haven't been added to the imports definition.

What we just did and how go get works. The go get command takes the path to the package and expects a version controlled and accessible path. It then clones this source code into your
$GOPATH/src directory ready for you to use in import paths as part of your projects.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github
ls
```

## Some common Go commands that you should know

1) ``` go build ``` (see below) this will build and compile your code into a binary

2) ``` go install ``` (see below) this will do the same as go build except drop it into your $GOPATH/bin dir

3) ``` go vet ``` This will check your code for common coding errors

4) ``` go test ``` (see below) This will run the test files in the given package

5) ``` go get ``` Pulls a dependency into your $GOPATH

## Create your first program
Create the following directory
```
  mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/<your_user>/hello
  cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/<your_user>/hello
  vi main.go
```
Add the following to main.go

```
package main
import(
    "fmt"
)

func main(){
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}

```
So what have we done here. the package indicates the name of the package we are in and the main function is similar to main for other languages. It is the entrypoint.

functions are defined as func.

We are importing the fmt package from the stdlib and then using it to print to stdout.

```

go build .

```

The go build command will compile the source into a binary and drop it in the current directory.

```
./hello

```

This should output ``` hello world ```

```
rm ./hello

go install .

hello

```
The go install command installs the binary to the $GOPATH/bin dir which is on your path so you can use the program without the ./

Finally open the main.go file and change the formatting to be terrible...

```
go fmt .

```

Open main.go and it will be correctly formatted again.



## Create the first test for your program

The convention in Go is to put your tests alongside the code that it tests rather than in a different directory somewhere. This has the advantage of giving a very visible
way of seeing what has tests and what doesn't. All test files in Go are named _test.go anything named that way will not be added to the final binary.


reopen main.go and change it to look like the following :

```
package main
import(
    "fmt"
)

//This is a public function exposed from the package. A exported functions must start with an Uppercase letter.
// the return type of this function is a string as shown by the definition
func HelloWorld()string{
    return "hello world"
}

func main(){
    fmt.Println(HelloWorld())
}

```

open main_test.go

```
  vi main_test.go
```

Add the following code

```
pacakge main

import(
    "testing"
)

//All test functions accept an argument of a pointer to testing.T
func Test_HelloWorld(t *testing.T){
    val := HelloWorld()
    if (val != "hello world"){
        t.Fail()
    }
}

```

Here we have imported the stdlib [testing package](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) and defined a test in the standard way that accepts a pointer to a type of t.Testing.
Then we call our HelloWorld function and check that the value returned matches what we expected.

To run this test run the following command

```
go test

```

To get more verbose output add -v

```
go test -v

```

## Viewing docs about stdlib packages or any package

You can google the package and read the online docs at :

```
https://golang.org/pkg/
```

You can also use the godoc command any any package. For example run the following command to see the docs for the testing pkg

```
godoc testing

```


## Editors and integration
Most main editors have some support for Go

- Visual Studio Code Has a good Go plugin [download](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Intellij Also has a good Go plugin [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Sublime Text3 Takes a bit of setting up but works quite well [tutorial](https://www.wolfe.id.au/2015/03/05/using-sublime-text-for-go-development/)
- Atom plugin [download](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus)

## Optional Homework

If you wanted to learn more (I will be going through more next week), now that you have your
environment setup, I would recommend looking at [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) that essentially start where we have left off.
